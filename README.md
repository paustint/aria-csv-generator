#Aria CSV Generator

##Summary

This project generates CSV data sheets for use in other API uploader tools.

##Setup

To use the dockerized version, run `docker-compose up` and the program will start on port 3000.

This program is only of use to folks that have Aria Systems API credentials (because API calls are made to retreive data for generation) and in combination with other uploader tools.
